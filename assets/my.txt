this part is my best part for my skill level you know robotics is my love
so he indroduced Arduino board then he board wih glowing led cube i shock first time i saw 
here my confident level is increase hey finally we close robotics that time 
then i learned from youtube what is arduino ? how works ? how to  program? like all
and i learned electronics also and learned pnumatics electro pnuematics siemens plc 
that he was indroduced 3d printing that time i exited to work with 3d print so he teaching solidworks and then we work with 3d printers best part my life 
then my sir collecting funds to they friends and giving raspberry pi and class conducting and bad luck learning time corona is coming stopped learnings then class incomplete and i have chance to get my company texmo industries inside raspberry pi projects then i learned from youtube and improving my programming skills and electrical and electronics and iot and iiot all i learned and excuting in our company inside there i have developing more projects here i thank to my superviser mr.vishnu prabu sir

My Journey to Mechatronics
Choosing a Path

After finishing high school, I was unsure about my next step. A relative suggested the Mechatronics Swiss Vocational Diploma program at Texmo Academy in Coimbatore.

A Spark of Inspiration

Intrigued, I searched "mechatronics" online. While the images mostly showed robots, it resonated with my childhood passion for building robots. Back in 6th grade, I used recycled materials like paper and motors to create a robot with a 360-degree rotating head. It may sound simple now, but it fueled my desire to become a scientist - someone who could build amazing things.
